Hey!! This is the first iter idea for Meow60. I hope to make this into a keyboard for cat ppl like myself. Pretty simple, it uses a 60% compact layout with some really cool stuff.

I hope to make this wireless, normal mx stem switches, an oled maybe? (nyan cat or something cat related). also neopixels!

I started on the keyboard and ended up finding a pretty basic one that I would enjoy using (one that im used to) and I drew some lines to show the row column system for each key!
